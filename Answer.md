### 1. Relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" entities:

The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities appears to be a one-to-many relationship. Each product in the "Product" table can be associated with only one category from the "Product_Category" table.
However, each category in the "Product_Category" table can have multiple products associated with it.

### 2. Ensuring each product has a valid category:

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can implement a foreign key constraint. 
This constraint will enforce referential integrity, ensuring that the value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table exists in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. 
This way, any attempt to insert or update a product with an invalid category will result in an error, preventing inconsistencies in the database.
